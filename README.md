## Change Log:
### v 2.0.1
* Add link to Homey community Forum   

### v 2.0.0
* Major app update to SDK2, _requires Homey SW release >=1.5.6_
* Add support for the ZHC5002   
* Added all options to support FW 2.x (secure inclusion) of [ZHC5010](http://logichome.dk/index.php/10-support-categories/6-zhc5010-firmware) and ZHC5002   
* Restructured parameters settings to simplify options   
### Release notes:
* Re-pairing (removal and inclusion) based on new app strongly recommended for ZHC5010 (scene flowcards will not work)
* It is advised to remove devices before updating the v 2.0.0 as this will reset the device and erase inclusion.
* Not removing a device prior to installation of v 2.0.0 will result in five orphaned devices that has to be deleted individually afterwards.
